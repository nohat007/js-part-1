          if the var = nothing then its undefined,cant use reserved  keywords,should be meaninngful,no space or hyphen, camelNotationNames, case sensitive

        </p>


    <h2>Constants </h2>
      <p>
        Variable that you don't want to change,assign it a constant value, Rule : if your not gonna be changing the variable, use const if not then use let

    <h2>Primitive types</h2>
      <p>
        prim = string,numbers,bool,undefined,null,
        ref  = object,array,function
        *null is situation to clear the value of variable
