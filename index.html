    <h1>Welcome to my pratice</h1>
      <p> Programming language , used to build shit, front and back
          runs on browers and node(v8 engine to run outside browser)
          Ecma script is a org that defines standards and rules and features.
      </p>

    <h2>variables</h2>
        <p>named buckets to hold data(box with a label)
          if the var = nothing then its undefined,cant use reserved  keywords,should be meaninngful,no space or hyphen, camelNotationNames, case sensitive

        </p>


    <h2>Constants </h2>
      <p>
        Variable that you don't want to change,assign it a constant value, Rule : if your not gonna be changing the variable, use const if not then use let

      </p>
    <h2>Primitive types</h2>
      <p>
        prim = string,numbers,bool,undefined,null,
        ref  = object,array,function
        *null is situation to clear the value of variable


      </p>
    <h2>Dynamic typing</h2>
      <p>Js is a dynamic language not static. In static when u declae a var u need to specify its type and that can;t change in the future.In Js type can chaneat run time.
        typeof name
        all Numbers are tyoe number

      </p>
    <h2>Objects</h2>
      <p>like an object in real life,and object has proerties and such, multiple related variables.
      reference that object.
      access object by dot notation or bracte notation
      person.name or person["name"]
      bractket is used  when u dont know the name of the variable and u put the holder in


       </p>
    <h2>Arrays</h2>
      <p>List
        each item in the lst was an index starting at 0
        each item doesnt have to be the same type.
        size and objects are dynamic
        arrayshave properties cuz they are objects

      </p>
    <h2>Functions</h2>
      <p>
        set of statements that performs a task or calcu;ates values, can take input but doesnt have too


      </p>
    <h2>Types of functions</h2>

      <p>
        functions that pefrom a task, function that calculate and return a value
      </p>

      <h1>Operators</h1>
      <h2>Js Ops</h2>

      <p>
        We use them to make expressions and with those expressions, we can implemet logic and algorithm
        (arithmetic,assignment,comparison,logical,bitwise)
        * expression is something that produces a value
      </p>
      <h2>Arithmetic Op</h2>

      <p>
        Use them to perfrom calculations just like in math
        (+,=,*,/, **) , (++X,X++, --)
      </p>
      <h2>Assignment Op( = )</h2>

      <p>
        To asign a value to a variable,
        x++ same as x =x + 1
        x += 5
      </p>
      <h2>Comparison Op(>, >= , < ,<= , )</h2>


      <p>
        result is either True or False
      </p>
      <h2>Equality Op(=== , ==)</h2>

      <p>
        === strict , checks value and type
      == loose, checks only value, converts the value to the sme to check

      </p>
      <h2>ternanry Op</h2>

      <p>
        kinda like a if else ,takes condition that can be either true or false

        let nohat = age < 20 ? true : false
      </p>
      <h2>Logical Op(&&, ||, !)</h2>

      <p>
        make decisions based on multiple conditions

      </p>
      <h2>Logical ops with non-bool</h2>

      <p>
        what you get back isnt always true or false, its depends on the expressions you used. deoends on weather its truthy or falsy, its always
        falsy = false, 0 , "", null , undefined, NaN
        anything not falsy is thruthy
        || returns the first thruth, short circuting
        imagine for exmaple im building an app, and u need to pick a color, or use a default color,
        let color = your || default
        if you have a color then color is your, if no then its the default one cu your if falsy

      </p>

      <h2>Precedence of Ops</h2>

      <p>
       use brackets, have your prioitys first , think bedmas, just use brackets to be honest

      </p>

      <h1>Control flow</h1>

        <h2>if else</h2>

          <p>
           Implements interctivity, 2 conditioonal
           if else is and conditional option tree
           if true do this inside the block of codes
           else if for more than 3 options
           trailling else
           put shit in order

          </p>
          <h2>Switch</h2>

          <p>
           switch and case
           switch(var) and each of the cases are use to compare with the var
           need to add break to jump out of switch and default for the if none of the above case

          </p>
          <h2>For Loop</h2>

          <p>
           repeat an action a number of times
           all loops do the same, but have a diff in how they start or end

           for (initial; condition; increment/de ){
           //code
         }

          </p>
          <h2>whileLopps</h2>

          <p>
           broken down for loop , only diff is the you have to declare the variable expternally instead of in the for loop
           let i = 0
           while( i < 5)
           {
            code
            i++
           }


          </p>
          <h2>do...while</h2>

          <p>
           executes first, then it checks its loop condiiton to see if it needs to still loop

          </p>
          <h2>infinite loop</h2>

          <p>
            loop that runs forever
            breaks shit


          </p>
          <h2>For...in</h2>

          <p>
           iterate of propertys and values of and object

           for (let key in obj)
           obj[key]

          </p>
          <h2>for...of</h2>

          <p>
           iterate of array

           for (let ting of arr)
           ting holds the item of the array

          </p>
          <h2>Break and continue</h2>

          <p>
           changes how the loop behaves
           worksfor all loops
           break lets say u have  condition then say break, you jump out of the loop
           continue lets say for the same thing instead of jumpin gout of loop it'll jus t go back to the top of the loop, continue is more of a legacy thing

          </p>
